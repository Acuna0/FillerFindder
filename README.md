# About The Project

FillerFinder is a web application with user authentication that scrapes websites for information on the show being searched. The website will display whether
the specific episode of the searched show is worth watching, or ok to be skipped to avoid confusion about the story line. Also can save time in the cases
where a large majority of the show is not relevant to the main story line.
